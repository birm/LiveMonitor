LiveMonitor
by Ryan Birmingham

LiveMonitor allows for you to check on the status of your network services and devices. Check port status, see networked host information, and check log summaries.

Check ports: Define hosts and ports to check; check specific ports on specitic hosts, or ports on all hosts. LiveMonitor will asyncrounously check so you can get a concice picture of your network.

Check hosts: Quickly determine what's new and what's missing on your network.

Check logs: Write a rule to parse a log format, or use one of the existing ones. See warnings, errors, and odd behavior on multiple services on multiple hosts in one place.

Customize output: Want to use LiveMonitor as an api? Want a command line output? Create your own outputs to match your workflow.
